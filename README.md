# Vector Transport Free LBFGS on Riemannian Manifolds

The code for vector transport free LBFGS quasi-Newton's optimization on the Riemannian manifolds

This code is a modification of the following code in the manopt library: https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/solvers/bfgs/rlbfgs.m

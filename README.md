# Vector Transport Free LBFGS on Riemannian Manifolds

The code for vector transport free LBFGS quasi-Newton's optimization on the Riemannian manifolds

This code is a modification of the following codes in the manopt and pymanopt libraries: 
- https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/solvers/bfgs/rlbfgs.m
- https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt/blob/master/pymanopt/solvers/linesearch.py
